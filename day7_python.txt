Q) What is time complexity?
A) The time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.


Q)What are the different types of time complexities?
A) There are 5 types of time complexities,
	* Constant Time Complexity - O(1)
	* Logarithmic Time Complexity - O(log n)
	* Linear Time Complexity - O(n)
	* O(n log n) Time Complexity
	* Quadratic Time Complexity - O(n2)
